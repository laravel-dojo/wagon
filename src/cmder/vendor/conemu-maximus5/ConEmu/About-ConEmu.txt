ConEmu-Maximus5 - Handy Windows terminal


About ConEmu

    ConEmu-Maximus5 is a Windows console emulator with tabs, which presents
    multiple consoles and simple GUI applications as one customizable GUI
    window with various features.

    Initially, the program was created as a companion to Far Manager,
    my favorite shell replacement - file and archive management,
    command history and completion, powerful editor.

    Today, ConEmu can be used with any other console application or simple
    GUI tools (like PuTTY for example).

    ConEmu is an active project, open to suggestions.
